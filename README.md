# Overview
  Have you ever been annoyed because you had to go to a meeting halfway through watching a movie at home? Our program can give you a list of movies that you can finish just in time for your next schedule, so you don't have to care about runtime when you choose a movie to watch. 
  There are a lot of websites online, such as [iMDB]([url](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home)) that allow you to search for movies based on rating, number of votes, director, genre and more. However, to some movie-lovers' frustration, these websites lack a way to filter movies by runtime.
