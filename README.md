## Overview
  Have you ever been annoyed because you had to go to a meeting halfway through watching a movie at home? Our program can give you a list of movies that you can finish just in time for your next schedule, so you don't have to care about runtime when you choose a movie to watch. There are a lot of websites online, such as [iMDB]([url](https://www.imdb.com/?ref_=nv_home)) that allow you to search for movies based on rating, number of votes, director, genre and more. However, to some movie-lovers' frustration, these websites lack a way to filter movies by runtime. 
<br/>
  Using packages such as [Selenium]([url](https://www.selenium.dev/)) and [BeautifulSoup4]([url](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/)), our program is able to find you a list of recommended movies that you can finish just before you leave for your next schedule. In addition, you may filter the results using different criteria such as number of user votes, average rating, genre, and more to find the best movie for you more easily!
